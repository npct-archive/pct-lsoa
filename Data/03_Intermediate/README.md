# 03 Intermediate Data

This folder is for data that is created between the input and the output. It contains temporary data in /temp than can be deleted but also datasets that may be useful to keep as they are time consuming to produce or allow jumping off points to do a partial build.

N.B. Anything in the temp folder can be deleted without warning
